# My Greatest Fear
## Heights
  My greatest fear is heights, specifically feeling unbalanced while in a high location. I really don't like being close to ledges like a cliff for example. I first noticed this fear when on one of my first hikes with my father, we went on the hike the day after an ice storm and the hike was covered in ice. At one point we could see out over the cliff, and the only kind of grip to keep us from slipping was a single tree. I'm fine when I just stand, sit, or view while at great heights, but I don't like being close to falling, nor do I like moving while at great heights.
